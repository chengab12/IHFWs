read_serial4.m: Serial communication, analysis and processing of information from sensors
Lvbo.m: Filter the original information
save_read_serial.m: Adjust the format of sensor information
data_label.m: Labeling all data to facilitate neural networks training
CNN.m: Models for neural networks
Classfy.m: recognition
cap_data.mat: Stored information matrix
cap_data_cap1to6.mat: Data format conversion matrix
cap_data_8_15: Object recognition 15 samples collected. (Participant 1)
cap_data_8_20: Object recognition 20 samples collected. (Participant 2)
